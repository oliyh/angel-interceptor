Express relations between Pedestal interceptors

## Introduction

Pedestal interceptors are applied sequentially in the order in which they are specified, starting with
those defined at the service level and progressing on through those defined at route branch and finally route leaf level.

This can prevent reusable interceptors or require repetition, or require injection of interceptors at run time.
Angel Interceptor allows you to express relations between interceptors to gain maximum reuse without repetition.

## Examples

Imagine you are building an API for integration with multiple chat services.
You would naturally put `slack-auth` and `hipchat-auth` as interceptors on the appropriate route branches, as below.

```
["/api" ^:interceptors [increment-api-hits]
  ["/slack" ^:interceptors [slack-auth] ...]
  ["/hipchat" ^:interceptors [hipchat-auth] ...]]
```

You want to record how many times each account is using your API, so you add an interceptor to do this - `increment-api-hits` applies to all routes in the API.
This interceptor requires an `account-id` so it can increment the stats for the appropriate account.
You want to run it *before* the handler so that regardless of the outcome (success, failure, exception) you have recorded the hit.

The problem here is that in Pedestal the `increment-api-hits` interceptor will run *before* the `slack-auth` or `hipchat-auth` interceptors, so the account-id will not be available.

Angel Interceptor allows you to express relations between interceptors to allow you to solve this problem.

```
(require '[angel.interceptor :as ai])

["/api" ^:interceptors [(ai/interceptor increment-api-hits
                                        :requires [:account])]
  ["/slack" ^:interceptors [(ai/interceptor slack-auth
                                            :provides [:account])] ...]
  ["/hipchat" ^:interceptors [(ai/interceptor hipchat-auth
                                              :provides [:account])] ...]]
```

Angel Interceptor will then reorder your interceptors such that `increment-api-hits` will run immediately after `slack-auth` or `hipchat-auth`.
